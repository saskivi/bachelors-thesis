Detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring, climate change detection, speech and image analysis, and human activity analysis. This survey article enumerates, categorizes, and compares many of the methods that have been proposed to detect change points in time series. The methods examined include both supervised and unsupervised algorithms that have been introduced and evaluated. We introduce several criteria to compare the algorithms. Finally, we present some grand challenges for the community to consider.},

  abstract = {A sequence of observations undergoes sudden changes at unknown times. We model the process by supposing that there is an underlying sequence of parameters partitioned into contiguous blocks of equal parameter values; the beginning of each block is said to be a change point. Observations are then assumed to be independent in different blocks given the sequence of parameters. In a Bayesian analysis it is necessary to give probability distributions to both the change points and the parameters. We use product partition models (Barry and Hartigan 1992), which assume that the probability of any partition is proportional to a product of prior cohesions, one for each block in the partition, and that given the blocks the parameters in different blocks have independent prior distributions. Given the observations a new product partition model holds, with posterior cohesions for the blocks and new independent block posterior distributions for parameters. The product model thus provides a convenient machinery for allowing the data to weight the partitions likely to hold; inference about particular parameters may then be made by first conditioning on the partition, and then averaging over all partitions. The parameter values may be estimated exactly in O(n3) calculations, or to an adequate approximation by Markov sampling techniques that are O(n) in the number of observations. The Markov sampling computations are thus practicable for long sequences. We compare this model with a number of alternative approaches to fitting change points and parameters when the error distribution is normal, then show that the proposed method is superior to the alternatives in detecting sharp short-lived changes in the parameters.},

This method is required for TV broadcast macro-segmentation which is at the root of many novel services related to TV broadcast and in particular to the TV-on-Demand service. Repeated sequence detection allows inter-program detection (commercials, jingles, credits, . . .), which allows the segmentation of the TV broadcast and the extraction of useful programs. Our method is completely nonsupervised, that is, it does not require a manually created reference database. It relies on a micro-clustering technique that groups similar audio/visual feature vectors. Clusters are then analyzed and repeated sequences are detected. This method is able to continuously analyze the TV broadcast and to periodically return analysis results. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method have been shown on two real broadcasts of 12 h and 7 days.},

As compared to our previous paper on this topic (BirgE and Massart in J. Eur. Math. Soc. 3 , 203-268 (2001)), more elaborate forms of the penalties are given which are shown to be, in some sense, optimal. We indeed provide more precise upper bounds for the risk of the penalized estimators and lower bounds for the penalty terms, showing that the use of smaller penalties may lead to disastrous results. These lower bounds may also be used to design a practical strategy that allows to estimate the penalty from the data when the amount of noise is unknown. We provide an illustration of the method for the problem of estimating a piecewise constant signal in Gaussian noise when neither the number, nor the location of the change points are known.

  abstract = {The explosive development of information science and technology puts in new problems involving statistical data analysis. These problems result from higher re quirements concerning the reliability of statistical decisions, the accuracy of math ematical models and the quality of control in complex systems. A new aspect of statistical analysis has emerged, closely connected with one of the basic questions of cynergetics: how to "compress" large volumes of experimental data in order to extract the most valuable information from data observed. De tection of large "homogeneous" segments of data enables one to identify "hidden" regularities in an object's behavior, to create mathematical models for each seg ment of homogeneity, to choose an appropriate control, etc. Statistical methods dealing with the detection of changes in the characteristics of random processes can be of great use in all these problems. These methods have accompanied the rapid growth in data beginning from the middle of our century. According to a tradition of more than thirty years, we call this sphere of statistical analysis the "theory of change-point detection. " During the last fifteen years, we have witnessed many exciting developments in the theory of change-point detection. New promising directions of research have emerged, and traditional trends have flourished anew. Despite this, most of the results are widely scattered in the literature and few monographs exist. A real need has arisen for up-to-date books which present an account of important current research trends, one of which is the theory of non parametric change--point detection.},

Usually, breaks are broadcasted several times during a stream. Thus, the detection of these repetitions can be considered as a key tool for stream structuring. After the detection stage, a classification method is applied to separate the repetitions in programs and breaks. In their turn, breaks repetitions are then used to classify the segments which appear only once in the stream. Finally, the stream is aligned with an electronic program guide (EPG), in order to annotate the programs. Our experiments have been applied on a 22-day long TV stream, and results show the efficiency of the proposed method in TV stream structuring.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting changes in the CDSS operation, in particular its monitoring and alerting subsystem, by monitoring its rule firing counts. We aim to screen and detect changes in real-time, that is whenever a new datum (rule firing count) arrives, we want to have a score indicating how likely there is a change in the system. We develop a new method based on Seasonal-Trend decomposition with locally weighted regression (Loess) and likelihood ratio statistics to detect the changes. Experiments on daily rule-firing-count data collected from a real CDSS and known change-points show that our method improves the detection performance when compared with existing change-point detection methods.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of TV stream macro-segmentation which consists of automatically determining the start and the end of each broadcasted program and interprogram (e.g. commercial, trailer). As programs do not share any common features, this paper focuses in particular on detecting inter-programs. Programs are then extracted as the rest of the stream. More precisely, interprograms are detected by their repetition property. This paper shows in a experimental way that almost all interprograms are broadcasted several times in the stream and they are repeated sufficiently in order to achieve an accurate macro-segmentation. It also presents a repeated sequence technique and a rule-based technique that performs macrosegmentation using detected repeated sequences. Our macro-segmentation solution is completely automatic, it outperforms the metadata macro-segmentation that comes with the TV stream and it requires less than two days of accumulated TV stream. The effectiveness of the approach is shown experimentally on a real continuous 7 days TV broadcast.},

The proposed video-text-detection technique is capable of adaptively applying appropriate operators for video frames of different modalities by classifying the background complexities. Effective operators such as the repeated shifting operations are applied for the noise removal of images with high edge density. Meanwhile, a text-enhancement technique is used to highlight the text regions of low-contrast images. A coarse-to-fine projection technique is then employed to extract text lines from video frames. Experimental results indicate that the proposed text-detection approach is superior to the machine-learning-based (such as SVM and neural network), multiresolution-based, and DCT-based approaches in terms of detection and false-alarm rates. Besides text detection, a technique for text segmentation is also proposed based on adaptive thresholding. A commercial OCR package is then used to recognize the segmented foreground text. A satisfactory character-recognition rate is reported in our experiments.},

Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{$<>$}},

The methods examined include the standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Wilcoxon's nonparametric test, two-phase regression (TPR) procedures, inhomogeneity tests, information criteria procedures, and various variants thereof. All of these methods have been proposed in the climate literature to detect undocumented changepoints, but heretofore there has been little formal comparison of the techniques on either real or simulated climate series. This study seeks to unify the topic, showing clearly the fundamental differences among the assumptions made by each procedure and providing guidelines for which procedures work best in different situations. It is shown that the common trend TPR and Sawa's Bayes criteria procedures seem optimal for most climate time series, whereas the SNH procedure and its nonparametric variant are probably best when trend and periodic effects can be diminished by using homogeneous reference series. Two applications to annual mean temperature series are given. Directions for future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Advertisement breaks during or between television programmes are typically recognised by a series of `black' video frames simultaneously accompanying a depression in audio volume which separate each advertisement from one another by recurrently occurring before and after each individual advertisement. It is the regular prevalence of these flags that enables automatic differentiation between what is programme and what is a commercial break. This paper reports on the progress made in the development of this idea into an advertisement detector system that automatically detects the commercial breaks from the bitstream of digitally captured television broadcasts.},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01\textendash 0.07 {$\sigma$}) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1\textendash 0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

  abstract = {In multiple change-point problems, different data segments often follow different distributions, for which the changes may occur in the mean, scale or the entire distribution from one segment to another.Without the need to know the number of change-points in advance, we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to detecting multiple change-points. Our method does not impose any parametric assumption on the underlying distributions of the data sequence, which is thus suitable for detection of any changes in the distributions. The number of change-points is determined by the Bayesian information criterion and the locations of the change-points can be estimated via the dynamic programming algorithm and the use of the intrinsic order structure of the likelihood function. Under some mild conditions, we show that the new method provides consistent estimation with an optimal rate. We also suggest a prescreening procedure to exclude most of the irrelevant points prior to the implementation of the nonparametric likelihood method. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance of identifying multiple change-points in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time. \textcopyright{} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.},
