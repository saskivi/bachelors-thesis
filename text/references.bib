  abstract = {This paper presents a system that labels TV shots either as commercial or program shots. The system uses two observations: logo presence and shot duration. These observations are modeled using HMMs, and a Viterbi decoder is finally used for shot labeling. The system has been tested on several hours of real video, achieving more than 99\% correct labeling.},

  abstract = {Change points are abrupt variations in time series data. Such abrupt changes may represent transitions that occur between states. Detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring, climate change detection, speech and image analysis, and human activity analysis. This survey article enumerates, categorizes, and compares many of the methods that have been proposed to detect change points in time series. The methods examined include both supervised and unsupervised algorithms that have been introduced and evaluated. We introduce several criteria to compare the algorithms. Finally, we present some grand challenges for the community to consider.},

These include tests for symmetry about zero, changes in distribution, independence and exponentiality. The approach is to localize the empirical likelihood using a suitable 'time' variable implicit in the null hypothesis and then form an integral of the log-likelihood ratio statistic. The asymptotic null distributions of these statistics are established. In simulation studies, the proposed statistics are found to have greater power than corresponding Cram\'er-von Mises type statistics. \textcopyright{} 2003 ISI/BS.},

Some analyses and evaluations show that as compared with the traditional recording model that records channels all the time, the proposed relay recording model is beneficial on the storage usage of nPVR server for most live broadcast channelS.},

These can be either archived as part of our audio-visual heritage or used to build added-value novel TV services like TVoD or Catch-up-TV. First, the problem of digital TV content structuring is positioned. Related work and existing solutions are deeply and carefully analyzed. This paper presents then DealTV, our fully automatic system. It is based on studying repeated sequences in the TV stream in order to segment it. Segments are then classified using an inductive logic programming-based technique that makes use of the temporal relationships between segments. Metadata are finally used to label and extract programs using simple overlapping-based criteria. Each processing step of DealTV has been separately evaluated in order to carefully analyze its impact on the final results. The system has been proven on a real TV stream to be very effective.},

  abstract = {The Centre for Digital Video Processing at Dublin City University conducts concentrated research and development in the area of digital video management. The current stage of development is demonstrated on our Web-based digital video system called F{\'\i}schl\'ar (Proceedings of the Content based Multimedia Information Access, RIAO 2000, Vol. 2, Paris, France, 12\textendash 14 April 2000, p. 1390), which provides for efficient recording, analysing, browsing and viewing of digitally captured television programmes. Advertisement breaks during or between television programmes are typically recognised by a series of `black' video frames simultaneously accompanying a depression in audio volume which separate each advertisement from one another by recurrently occurring before and after each individual advertisement. It is the regular prevalence of these flags that enables automatic differentiation between what is programme and what is a commercial break. This paper reports on the progress made in the development of this idea into an advertisement detector system that automatically detects the commercial breaks from the bitstream of digitally captured television broadcasts.},

Each of those elements is described, reviewed and discussed separately. Implementations of the main algorithms described in this article are provided within a Python package called ruptures.},

  abstract = {In multiple change-point problems, different data segments often follow different distributions, for which the changes may occur in the mean, scale or the entire distribution from one segment to another.Without the need to know the number of change-points in advance, we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to detecting multiple change-points. Our method does not impose any parametric assumption on the underlying distributions of the data sequence, which is thus suitable for detection of any changes in the distributions. The number of change-points is determined by the Bayesian information criterion and the locations of the change-points can be estimated via the dynamic programming algorithm and the use of the intrinsic order structure of the likelihood function. Under some mild conditions, we show that the new method provides consistent estimation with an optimal rate. We also suggest a prescreening procedure to exclude most of the irrelevant points prior to the implementation of the nonparametric likelihood method. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance of identifying multiple change-points in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time. \textcopyright{} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.},
