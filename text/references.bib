This method is required for TV broadcast macro-segmentation which is at the root of many novel services related to TV broadcast and in particular to the TV-on-Demand service. Repeated sequence detection allows inter-program detection (commercials, jingles, credits, . . .), which allows the segmentation of the TV broadcast and the extraction of useful programs. Our method is completely nonsupervised, that is, it does not require a manually created reference database. It relies on a micro-clustering technique that groups similar audio/visual feature vectors. Clusters are then analyzed and repeated sequences are detected. This method is able to continuously analyze the TV broadcast and to periodically return analysis results. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method have been shown on two real broadcasts of 12 h and 7 days.},

Usually, breaks are broadcasted several times during a stream. Thus, the detection of these repetitions can be considered as a key tool for stream structuring. After the detection stage, a classification method is applied to separate the repetitions in programs and breaks. In their turn, breaks repetitions are then used to classify the segments which appear only once in the stream. Finally, the stream is aligned with an electronic program guide (EPG), in order to annotate the programs. Our experiments have been applied on a 22-day long TV stream, and results show the efficiency of the proposed method in TV stream structuring.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting changes in the CDSS operation, in particular its monitoring and alerting subsystem, by monitoring its rule firing counts. We aim to screen and detect changes in real-time, that is whenever a new datum (rule firing count) arrives, we want to have a score indicating how likely there is a change in the system. We develop a new method based on Seasonal-Trend decomposition with locally weighted regression (Loess) and likelihood ratio statistics to detect the changes. Experiments on daily rule-firing-count data collected from a real CDSS and known change-points show that our method improves the detection performance when compared with existing change-point detection methods.},

More precisely, interprograms are detected by their repetition property. This paper shows in a experimental way that almost all interprograms are broadcasted several times in the stream and they are repeated sufficiently in order to achieve an accurate macro-segmentation. It also presents a repeated sequence technique and a rule-based technique that performs macrosegmentation using detected repeated sequences. Our macro-segmentation solution is completely automatic, it outperforms the metadata macro-segmentation that comes with the TV stream and it requires less than two days of accumulated TV stream. The effectiveness of the approach is shown experimentally on a real continuous 7 days TV broadcast.},

The methods examined include the standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Wilcoxon's nonparametric test, two-phase regression (TPR) procedures, inhomogeneity tests, information criteria procedures, and various variants thereof. All of these methods have been proposed in the climate literature to detect undocumented changepoints, but heretofore there has been little formal comparison of the techniques on either real or simulated climate series. This study seeks to unify the topic, showing clearly the fundamental differences among the assumptions made by each procedure and providing guidelines for which procedures work best in different situations. It is shown that the common trend TPR and Sawa's Bayes criteria procedures seem optimal for most climate time series, whereas the SNH procedure and its nonparametric variant are probably best when trend and periodic effects can be diminished by using homogeneous reference series. Two applications to annual mean temperature series are given. Directions for future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01\textendash 0.07 {$\sigma$}) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1\textendash 0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

  abstract = {In multiple change-point problems, different data segments often follow different distributions, for which the changes may occur in the mean, scale or the entire distribution from one segment to another.Without the need to know the number of change-points in advance, we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to detecting multiple change-points. Our method does not impose any parametric assumption on the underlying distributions of the data sequence, which is thus suitable for detection of any changes in the distributions. The number of change-points is determined by the Bayesian information criterion and the locations of the change-points can be estimated via the dynamic programming algorithm and the use of the intrinsic order structure of the likelihood function. Under some mild conditions, we show that the new method provides consistent estimation with an optimal rate. We also suggest a prescreening procedure to exclude most of the irrelevant points prior to the implementation of the nonparametric likelihood method. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance of identifying multiple change-points in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time. \textcopyright{} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.},
